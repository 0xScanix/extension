## ðŸ”Ž About the project

Scanix is a lightweight and powerful Chrome extension that improves the experience of blockchain exploration directly to your browser. Simply highlight any address, transaction hash, or block number, right-click, and instantly get information about it. From Ethereum, Etherlink, Redstone and more

## ðŸ§° How It Works

First, find any blockchain data on a webpage â€” this can be an address, transaction hash, or block number. For example, highlight any of the below,

- 0xc9B53AB2679f573e480d01e0f49e2B5CFB7a3EAb
- 0x796Ea11Fa2dD751eD01b53C372fFDB4AAa8f00F9
- 0x24dc388fc939d9bc22c44e79526be919e509d7f2d5268537a4bcedab17e54ba0

Next, highlight the text, right-click, and choose "Search with Scanix" from the context menu.
